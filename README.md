This is a planet generator I made. It's [pretty!](http://imgur.com/a/2dHiZ) It's inspired by [this thing.](https://marian42.github.io/proceduralart/)

It's hosted on [Github Pages.](https://alan-luo.github.io/planetprocedural/)

You can find a pretty extensive documentation on my [knowledge base website.](http://docs.alanluo.com/?Projects%2FLittle-Planet-Procedural)
